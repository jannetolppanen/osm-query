OSM Structure Finder Project Prompt
You're helping me develop a Python project called "OSM Structure Finder" that fetches coordinates of specific structures (like churches, hospitals, etc.) from OpenStreetMap data.
Project Overview

Purpose: Retrieve coordinates and metadata for specific types of structures in given countries
Data Source: OpenStreetMap via Overpass API
Main Features: Country selection, structure type selection, data fetching and saving

Project Structure

Modular design with separate components for fetching, query building, and data saving
Configuration files for country codes
Data output in JSON format

Key Components

OSMDataFetcher class - Handles API requests to OpenStreetMap
DataSaver class - Handles saving the retrieved data

Usage Pattern

User specifies a country name (e.g., "Netherlands", "Vatican City")
User specifies a structure type (e.g., "church", "hospital")
System looks up the country's ISO code from a JSON file
System constructs an Overpass API query
System fetches the data and saves it as JSON

Implementation Details

Using ISO 3166 country codes for reliable queries
Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API calls
Saves output with naming convention: {country_name}_{structure_type}_length_{count}.json

Current Status

Basic functionality is working
Successfully tested with Vatican City (small country with few churches)
Working on making the project more modular and reusable

If you need to continue work on this project, I should focus on:

Improving modular structure
Expanding query capabilities
Adding more processing/filtering options
Better error handling
